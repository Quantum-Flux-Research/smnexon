Investigating the Cause of Genetic Defects in SMN1 Leading to Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)
###### **Summary:**

Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a devastating genetic disorder caused by defects in the SMN1 gene, leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. This research project aims to leverage the power of quantum computing and molecular biology to investigate the underlying causes of genetic defects in SMN1 and develop innovative strategies for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of SMA. By combining cutting-edge technologies from both fields, we seek to unravel the complex molecular mechanisms behind SMN1 defects and pave the way for ground-breaking advancements in the management of this debilitating condition.

Research Objectives:

1. Develop quantum algorithms to simulate and analyse the molecular dynamics of the SMN1 gene and its associated proteins.
2. Identify the specific genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to SMN1 defects and their role in the pathogenesis of SMA.
3. Establish a comprehensive molecular database of SMN1 variants and their functional consequences using quantum computing-assisted data analysis.
4. Develop novel diagnostic tools and biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of SMA based on quantum-enhanced molecular profiling.
5. Explore potential therapeutic targets and strategies for SMA by leveraging quantum-optimized drug discovery and design.
